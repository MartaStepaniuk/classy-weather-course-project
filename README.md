# Classy weather project

[Project](https://classy-weather-course-project.netlify.app/) developed as part of the course ["The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) together with instructor [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

While doing this project, I learned React before hooks: class-based React.
